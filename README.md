The IDL library from EBDL


The IDL EBDL (Ecosystems & Biogeochemical Dynamics Laboratory) User Library is a low-level ecosystem software written in the commercial language IDL. The goal of this package is to advance low-level spatial data operations automatically. For instance, some routines provides batch mosaic operation for a list of remote sensing images. 

The organization of this package was designed in a way that most of the data operations routines could be carried out seamless and sequentially with a specific hierarchical file system workspace.
